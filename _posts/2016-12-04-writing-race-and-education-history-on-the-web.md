Abstract: This panel contrasts how historians of race and education are authoring three digital books on the web, which raises provocative questions about the future of scholarly communication. Historian Matthew Delmont created open-access companion websites to accompany both of his recent books published by the University of California Press: _The Nicest Kids in Town_ <http://NicestKids.com/> and _Why Busing Failed_ <http://WhyBusingFailed.com>. Jack Dougherty and his contributors are creating _On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs_, a digital-first, open-access book with interactive maps and oral history videos, under contract with Amherst College Press <http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu>. Ansley Erickson and Esther Cyna and their colleagues are producing _Educating Harlem_, a digital history project in two interconnected parts that mix elements of traditional publishing with web-based open-access scholarship.
