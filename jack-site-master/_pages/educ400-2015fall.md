<strong>Course Description: </strong>To fulfill the senior exercise requirement, students carry out an independent research project that builds upon acquired skills and evolving interests. The weekly seminar provides a thematic focus as well as a continuous forum for both support and critical feedback from peers, in preparation for a public presentation of the student’s work at the end of the semester. To enroll, students must have completed <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/Declare.aspx">all core course requirements in the major</a>, and submit a <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/Junior-Research-Plans.aspx">Junior Research Plan</a> that has been approved by the Educational Studies faculty.
<div id="criteria"><strong>Research Project Criteria: </strong></div>
In this capstone seminar, Educational Studies majors design, conduct, and present an independent research project on a topic of interest, using primary and secondary sources, with qualitative, quantitative, and/or historical methods. The criteria below represent our student learning goals and express our common vocabulary for evaluating the quality of research projects across the multiple research traditions that influence our interdisciplinary program.

1) Does the author pose a thought-provoking, researchable question (or hypothesis) and explain its significance to educational studies?

2) Does the author connect the question to the existing research literature (secondary sources) and move beyond into new territory?

3) Does the author identify and use the most appropriate primary sources and research methods for this study?

4) Does the author present a clear and insightful thesis that directly addresses the research question (or hypothesis)?

5) Is the author's thesis persuasive, and supported with convincing evidence and analysis?

6) Is the author's essay/presentation well-organized, and does it include sufficient background for audiences unfamiliar with the topic?

7) Does the author cite sources in an acceptable format so that future readers may easily locate them? [Relevant for the final paper, not the presentation.]

8) Does the author follow ethical guidelines for research?

<strong>How to succeed in this seminar:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Bookmark this online syllabus and check it often for updates (marked in red).</li>
 	<li>Keep a calendar—paper or digital—to manage your time and meet deadlines.</li>
 	<li>Attend each class on time, bring relevant readings and notes, and participate regularly in discussions. The goal is to improve education for all, not you alone. At the end of the semester, your peers will evaluate your overall contribution to learning in the seminar.</li>
 	<li>Take the initiative by asking questions. If you don’t understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.</li>
 	<li>In this seminar, students are welcome to bring a computer for in-class writing and online research, but use it wisely. Focus on learning and avoid distractions.</li>
 	<li>Talk about what you are learning outside of class, both with your peers and the professor. <a href="jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu">Email me</a> any quick questions, or <a href="//commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/advising">book an appointment</a> for longer discussions.</li>
 	<li>Everyone—including your instructor—learns to improve our writing by sharing drafts, receiving reader feedback, and revising our prose. Make the most of peer editing opportunities and the <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/academics/centers/writing/WritingCenter/Pages/default.aspx">Writing Center</a>.</li>
 	<li>If you're concerned about a grade on an assignment, schedule an appointment to talk with me. Afterwards, if you wish to challenge a grade, write out a persuasive argument with supporting evidence.</li>
 	<li>If an illness or emergency interferes with attending class, email me immediately and make arrangements to catch up on missing work.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How your work will be evaluated</strong>, with individual scores on <a href="http://moodle.trincoll.edu">Moodle</a>:
<ul>
 	<li>Exercises (Writing Assignments, Peer Reviews, Progress Memos) for 2 points each x 15 = 30</li>
 	<li>Proposal presentations to guest evaluator = 10</li>
 	<li>Full draft (evaluated by instructor) = 10</li>
 	<li>Final presentation: guest evaluator selected by student with instructor, and evaluation by Ed Studies faculty (10 + 10 = 20)</li>
 	<li>Contribution to overall learning in the seminar (evaluated by peers) = 10</li>
 	<li>Final draft (evaluated by instructor, based on how the author has responded to feedback received during the semester and at the presentation) = 20</li>
</ul>
Total = 100 points

In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Students may access their individual scores on the password-protected Moodle site.

When a deadline says "Sept 21st" it means due before our seminar begins, unless stated otherwise. Exercises (worth 2 points) will be granted 1 point if poor quality or late (but submitted the same day), and 0 points if not submitted that day. Overdue major assignments will be penalized 10% for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline, with exceptions granted only for documented medical or family emergencies. A Google Doc that is not properly shared (so that anyone with the link may comment) will be considered late. Notify your instructor during add/drop week if you require any special accommodations (for religious observances, learning disabilities, etc.).
