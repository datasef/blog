**NOTE:** This is a backup copy of the syllabus. See the full course on this WordPress site <http://commons.trincoll.edu/edreform>

## Syllabus for Spring 2019

**Course description:** To what aims have education reformers aspired over time? When and how did schools become tools for divergent goals, such as reducing inequality, advancing capitalism, creating cultural uniformity, and liberating oppressed peoples?  Why have educational policies succeeded or failed to achieve these ends, and what were some of the unintended consequences? In this mid-level undergraduate course, we compare and contrast selected movements, both past and present, to reform elementary, secondary, and higher education in the United States from the nineteenth-century Common School era to contemporary debates over school choice, cultural differences, governance structures, and digital technology. Students will develop skills in reading and researching primary and secondary sources, interpreting divergent perspectives, and expository writing on the web. Cross-listed with American Studies and Public Policy & Law. Pre-requisite: Ed 200, or AMST or PBPL major, or permission of instructor.

**Time & location:** Mondays 6:30-9:10pm in Seabury S205 at Trinity College.  Students are encouraged to bring laptops for in-class notes and writing exercises. **Jump to:** [Week 1](#week1): Jan 28 -- [Week 2](#week2): Feb 4 -- [Week 3](#week3): Feb 11 -- [Week 4](#week4): Feb 18 -- [Week 5](#week5): Feb 25 -- [Week 6](#week6): March 4 -- [Week 7](#week7): March 11 -- [Week 8](#week8): March 25 -- [Week 9](#week9): April 1 -- [Week 10](#week10): April 8 -- [Week 11](#week11): April 15 -- [Week 12](#week12): April 22 -- [Week 13](#week13): April 29

**Learning Objectives:**
In this mid-level required course for Ed Studies majors, students will:

a) Interpret historical sources from different periods and perspectives to better understand how education has varied from their current-day experiences.

b) Compare and contrast different explanations about the causes and consequences of educational change and continuity over time.

c) Propose a research question, identify appropriate sources, and write a substantive essay that supports their thesis with persuasive evidence.

**About the instructor:** Jack Dougherty, Professor of Educational Studies at Trinity College, specializes in the history and policy of education in the metropolitan United States. He received his Ph.D. in educational policy studies, with a minor in U.S. history, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Assignments

Students may access their individual scores on the [password-protected Moodle site](http://moodle.trincoll.edu). Your work will be evaluated on the following:

**Interpretive reading quizzes** are due on password-protected [Moodle](http://moodle.trincoll.edu) site, usually at 9pm on the evening prior to class. Questions emphasize conceptual understanding, not trivial facts, and the format is open-book, with no time limit. Each student has only one opportunity to complete each quiz, which usually consists of 3 randomly-sorted, multiple-choice questions, which may vary from student to student. For each incorrect answer, a 33% penalty will be deducted, but students will receive a hint and another chance to respond. Students are encouraged to discuss readings with each other before taking the quiz, but once they have started or completed it, they MAY NOT communicate about its content in any way until the instructor reviews answers in class. When taking a Moodle quiz, be sure to "check" each answer, and also click "submit and finish" at the end. 9 quizzes x 3 points each = 27

**Writing assignments** evaluate information literacy and analytical thinking skills:

*   Annotate sources exercise = 3
*   Avoiding Plagiarism exercise = 3
*   Educational policy journalism = 5
*   Video documentary analysis = 5
*   Trinity 1960s archives exercise = 3
*   [Research essay process:](http://commons.trincoll.edu/edreform/assignments/research-essay-process/)
    *   Research proposal = 10
    *   Working draft + assigned peer reviews = 4
    *   Final web essay = 20

**Interpretive open-book exams** evaluate how students apply historical & policy concepts from syllabus readings to new source materials that have not yet been seen:

*   Exam 1 (midterm) = 10 points
*   Exam 2 (final exam) = 10 points

**Total = 100 points**

Late penalties: Reading quizzes must be completed by the deadline to receive any credit. For all other overdue assignments, a 10 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented medical or family emergencies. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Students are expected to engage in academic honesty in all forms of work for this course. You are responsible for understanding and following the Intellectual Honesty policy (around page 20) of the [Trinity Student Handbook](http://www.trincoll.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/StudentHandbook.pdf).

## Finding Sources: Search Strategies for Educ 300

**If you know little** about a topic, start with a tertiary source (such as [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/), the user-contributed encyclopedia) for a quick background and suggested secondary sources, to dig deeper with further reading. **To decide where to look** for the most appropriate sources, ask yourself: What type of person or organization might have created sources about this topic? Where might these people have archived or published these sources? **a) Academic Databases** **For a broad search** of scholarly secondary and primary sources, start with:

*   [Trinity Library Catalog](http://www.trincoll.edu/LITC/Library/Pages/default.aspx) or [Trinity WorldCat advanced search](https://trincoll.on.worldcat.org/advancedsearch?databaseList=): library catalog of books, chapters, media, articles, and archives, with links to items at Trinity, Conn College, Wesleyan, and elsewhere

## Research Essay Process

In _Educ 300: Education Reform, Past & Present_, the major writing assignment is a research essay that addresses **change and/or continuity over time** regarding any topic in education. By design, the boundaries are very broad. You may explore _**any topic**_ related to education, at _**any level inside the schooling system**_ (early childhood, elementary & secondary, or higher education) _**or outside the system**_ (home schooling, community-based education, etc.), in _**any location**_ (local, domestic, or international) _or **time period**_ (centuries ago or recent events), as long as you frame the question around change and/or continuity over time. Appropriate types of research questions that address change and/or continuity over time:

1.  historical origins -- _How did X first arise at this period in time?_
2.  historical causation -- _What factors caused X to happen over time?_
3.  multiple definitions  --  _How did different reformers envision X over time?_
4.  social history of human experiences -- _How did group Y experience X over time?_
5.  historiographical -- _How have different historians interpreted X over time?_
6.  policy formation --  _How did X arise as a policy issue over a specific period?_
7.  policy implementation -- _How was X transformed from policy into practice?_

See Ed 300 syllabus for many more examples. Combinations of two or more questions, or the creation of the entirely new and appropriate questions, are strongly encouraged. Types of questions that are NOT appropriate for an Educ 300 paper:

*   _What is the connection between X and Y?_ (vague link; no change over time)
*   _What if X became Y?_ (hypothetical question; usually no sources)
*   _How will group Y do X in years to come?_ (future speculation without sources)

Each student must complete these stages of the research paper process:

**A) Proposal** - Write a research essay proposal, typically around 500 words:

*   Identify your research question and justify why it matters
*   Describe where and how you searched for primary & secondary sources (include databases and keywords)
*   List a bibliography of the most appropriate sources (in any standard academic citation format)

Post on our [Google Doc Organizer](http://bit.ly/ed300-org-2019) by **Sun April 7th at 9pm**. See [sample proposals from 2018](http://bit.ly/ed300-org-2018). **B) Conference** - Schedule 20-minute appointment with instructor to discuss feedback either before OR after proposal deadline. Book automatically on my [online calendar](http://jackdougherty.org) OR email 2-3 possible dates/times. **C) Working thesis & evidence draft** - Start a draft of your essay (at least 750 words; more is encouraged) that includes: - Introductory paragraph that raises your research question - Introductory paragraph that answers it with a working thesis - Two or more body paragraphs that interpret your most interesting sources (with citations). Post as a link on our [Google Doc Organizer](http://bit.ly/ed300-org-2019) by Friday April 19th at 6pm. **D) Peer comments** - Read and write substantive comments on drafts by two other students in your assigned group, as listed in our [GoogleDoc Organizer](http://bit.ly/ed300-org-2019), by Monday April 22nd at 6pm.  Login with your Google username to prove that you wrote the comments. Please comment on evaluation criteria 1, 2, 4, and 5 below. Tell us what works in the essay, what could be improved, and your suggested next steps for the author. **E) Research presentation** - Prepare and deliver a substantive 2-minute presentation, in Google Slides format on our [GDoc Organizer](http://bit.ly/ed300-org-2019), due before our last class on Monday April 29th. Be sure to include: - engaging essay title - research question - working thesis (bullet points acceptable for presentations) - interpretation of at least one key source (which you can describe, quote, scan, or include as an image) Be prepared to write comments and vote on other students' presentations. **F) Final essay** - Post your final essay on WordPress (category = research essay 2019), at least 2,000 words (or more), addressing all of the evaluation criteria below by Friday May 3rd at 6pm. **Research Essay evaluation criteria:**

1.  Does the essay pose a thought-provoking research question that addresses change and/or continuity over time in education?
2.  Does the essay present a clear and insightful thesis that addresses the research question?
3.  Does the essay identify the most appropriate source materials and methods for researching this question?
4.  Is the essay's thesis persuasive? Is it supported with convincing evidence and analysis?
5.  Is the essay organized, clearly written, and does it include sufficient background for audiences unfamiliar with the topic?
6.  Does the essay cite sources (using any accepted academic format) so that future readers may easily locate them?
7.  Digital elements (such as images, charts, links to sources, etc.) are not required, but may count as additional visual evidence to enhance your essay. If you include visual elements, be sure to add captions to properly credit each source.
