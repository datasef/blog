Many students ask me to serve as a reference and/or to write a recommendation letter on their behalf for study-away programs, employment opportunities, and graduate schools. (If the latter topic interests you, see also: [Advice on applying to graduate school](http://jackdougherty.org/grad-school).) I'm usually very willing to assist students who I already know, as it's an important aspect of my role as an advisor, and one of the benefits of attending a small liberal arts college. Here's my advice on how to proceed with me (but be sure to ask other faculty, who may have different preferences or routines).

### To request listing me as a reference
- Send me an email stating that you wish to list me as a reference (which usually means giving someone my name and contact information, in case they wish to call or email me).
- Include the name of the person or organization that might contact me, and a description and/or weblink about the position or program.
- If I agree to be listed as your reference, you can list me again in the future, without requesting permission a second time.

### To request a recommendation letter
- Writing a recommendation letter requires a bit more work from both me and you. If you wish to discuss your plans with me, [book an appointment on my calendar](http://jackdougherty.org/advising).
- Email me your request, and include at least 1-2 paragraphs that answers this question: Why are you and this program a good match for one another?
- If you already addressed this question in personal essay for your application, feel free to send a draft to me, either in your email or as a Google Doc (be sure to set to Share > Advanced > Anyone can Comment.) Reading your words helps me to tailor my letter for your audience.
- If you have a resume, also send me a copy so that I can learn more about you.
- Include clear instructions about the deadline and where to send your letter. Some programs request that I email it directly to them, while others require you to fill out an online form that automatically sends me a link to upload your letter.
- If you are applying to multiple programs, send me a summary list (or even better, a Google Spreadsheet that we can both view, to help us keep track of instructions and deadlines).
- If I agree to write a letter on your behalf, my normal practice is to share the text of the letter with you, the student, after I send it. This makes the process more transparent and educational, and also gives you an opportunity to spot factual errors or typos for me to correct in future versions.
