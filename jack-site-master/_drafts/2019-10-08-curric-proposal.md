This fall, the Curriculum Committee at Trinity College circulated a new draft of a proposal. Here's my unofficial summary:

1) Currently the College counts “credits” generically. New proposal would split credits into three groups:
	a) Academic credits: regular courses, internships in the major, etc.
	b) Co-curricular credits: internships outside the major, TAs, J-Term, paid summer research such as PHC, etc.
	c) Wellness credits: physical ed classes, participation on athletic teams, some theater & dance classes, mindfulness classes, etc.
2) Current grad requirement is 36 generic credits. Proposal calls for new requirement of a minimum of 32 academic credits, plus up to 3 co-curricular credits, plus 1 wellness credit. Since co-curricular credits are optional, students could graduate with 35 academic credits + 1 wellness credit.
3) While the 3 co-curricular credits would be optional and students could enroll in them individually, Trinity would label this as “Trinity Plus” and encourage departments to submit proposals to Curric Cmte for an “Integrated Option, with experiential certificate,” meaning some pre-designated combination of academic credits and co-curricular credits, which would appear as a certificate on students’ transcripts.
4) Global requirement would be dropped from General Ed Requirement.
