## Syllabus for Fall 2016
Tuesdays & Thursdays (TR), 9:25-10:40am in MCEC 220 Prof. [Jack Dougherty](http://bit.ly/jackdougherty) - [contact me or book an appointment](http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/advising) [Educational Studies Program](http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/default.aspx) at Trinity College, Hartford CT Teaching Assistants: [Doug Curtin '17](mailto:douglas.curtin@trincoll.edu) and [Vianna Iorio '19](http://vianna.iorio@trincoll.edu) In this online syllabus, major changes appear in red and links to come appear with asterisks(\*)

Jump to unit: [Sociology of Classroom](#classroom) -- [Theories of Learning](#learning) -- [Explaining Inequality](#inequality) -- [Teaching for Change](#curriculum) -- [Philosophy of Ed](#philosophy) Jump to month: [Sept](#september) -- [Oct](#october) -- [Nov](#november) -- [Dec](#december)

## Course description:
This course introduces the study of schooling within an interdisciplinary framework. Drawing upon anthropology and sociology, we investigate the resources, structures, and social contexts that influence student opportunities and unequal outcomes in the United States and other countries. From psychology, we contrast different theories of learning, both in the abstract and in practice. Finally, using philosophical thinking, we investigate how competing educational goals should be resolved in a democratic society. The course also includes a community learning component, where students engage in participant-observation for three hours per week in nearby public elementary and secondary classrooms, and integrate first-hand experiences with discussions of course readings and writing assignments.

## How to succeed in this course:

*   Bookmark this online syllabus and check it often for updates (marked in red).
*   Keep a calendar—paper or digital—to manage your time and meet deadlines.
*   Attend each class on time, bring relevant readings and notes, and participate regularly in discussions. The goal is to improve education for all, not you alone. At the end of the semester, your peers will evaluate your overall contribution to learning in the class.
*   Take the initiative by asking questions. If you don’t understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
*   In this class, students are welcome to bring a computer for in-class writing and online research, but use it wisely. Focus on learning and avoid distractions.
*   Talk about what you are learning outside of class, both with your peers and the professor. [Email me](jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) any quick questions, or [book an appointment](//commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/advising) for longer discussions.
*   Learn from our teaching assistants, who facilitate small-group discussions in class, make time to meet with students outside of class, and offer additional feedback on student writing.
*   Everyone—including your instructor—learns to improve our writing by sharing drafts, receiving reader feedback, and revising our prose. Make the most of peer editing opportunities and the [Writing Center](http://www.trincoll.edu/academics/centers/writing/WritingCenter/Pages/default.aspx).
*   If you're concerned about a grade on an assignment, schedule an appointment to talk with me. Afterwards, if you wish to challenge a grade, write out a persuasive argument with supporting evidence.
*   If an illness or emergency interferes with attending class, email me immediately and make arrangements to catch up on missing work.

## How your work will be evaluated
with individual scores [on Moodle](http://moodle.trincoll.edu):

*   Four short essays to integrate theory and practice (x 10 = 40 points)

1.  Theories of Learning
2.  Explaining Educational Inequality
3.  Teaching for Change
4.  Curriculum Design Proposal

*   Ten writing exercises to promote reflective thinking (x 2 = 20 points)

1.  Introduce yourself and potential contributions to your placement teacher
2.  Improve observation skills by contrasting learning in classroom videos
3.  Reflect on first day at placement and connect to one or more syllabus readings
4.  Upload a scanned signed copy of placement contract
5.  Write a rich vignette on student learning at your school placement
6.  Peer edit an assigned student's learning vignette to improve clarity
7.  Share assigned inequality reading notes, due 24 hours before class
8.  Submit draft and peer edit classmate's draft on educational inequality
9.  Curriculum Project Starter Proposal: topic, grade(s), 3 objectives
10.  Evaluate what you learned at your school placement

*   Classroom Participant-Observation (evaluated by classroom teacher) = 10
*   Curriculum Project - Oral Presentation (evaluated by coordinators) = 10
*   Curriculum Project Final Draft (evaluated by instructor) = 10
*   Overall Contribution to Learning in the Class (evaluated by peers) = 10
*   Cumulative Final Exam = 10

NOTE: Initially, the total number of points equals 110. When calculating the final grade, your lowest 10-point grade will be dropped, resulting in an adjusted total of 100 points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Students may access their individual scores on the password-protected Moodle site. _PS: If you're obsessing over these details, you probably have lost sight of the larger purpose of learning. Come talk with me!_

Late 10-point assignments will be penalized 10% for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline, with exceptions granted only for medical or family emergencies. Late or incomplete 2-point exercises will receive only 1 point (if re-submitted within 24 hours of the deadline), or 0 points afterwards, with exceptions only for medical or family emergencies. A Google Doc that is not properly shared (so that anyone with the link may comment) will be considered late. Notify your instructor during add/drop week if you require any special accommodations (for religious observances, learning disabilities, etc.).
