### Description
In this upper-level undergraduate seminar, our primary goal is to work as a team to strengthen our skills in basic qualitative and quantitative research on race, class, and educational policy. We will closely read studies by other authors, then design and conduct our own small-scale research projects, and publicly present our findings. Our theme for Fall 2019 is "Researching Trinity and Hartford."

### Our Research Projects
We will conduct interviews with a stratified random sample of Trinity students to ask:

1. How do perceptions and experiences of Hartford vary among first-year Trinity students of different racial, social class, and gender backgrounds?

2. How do perceptions and experiences of race and social class at Trinity vary among first-year students of different backgrounds?

3. How do perceptions and experiences of the Community Action Gateway students (a non-random self-selected sample) compare to our stratified random sample of other first-year students?

In addition, for the Community Learning component of this course, we will attend Hartford neighborhood group meetings to share the results of a recent door-to-door survey on how community residents perceive and experience Trinity College, and listen to how participants respond to this study.

### Requirements
Students must bring a copy of this book, print or digital, for a close reading of the text in class and discussion with the author:

  Anthony Abraham Jack, *The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students* (Harvard University Press, 2019), <https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv6EDwAAQBAJ>.

Photocopies of additional readings will be made available to students for $10 fee.

Each student must bring a laptop to each class session for writing, editing, and data analysis. Contact me if you need to borrow a spare laptop.

Late assignments will receive a 10 percent penalty for every 12 hours overdue, with exceptions granted only for verified medical or family emergencies. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+.
